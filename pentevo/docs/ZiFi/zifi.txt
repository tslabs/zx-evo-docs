0xC2EF          R     RIFR  Input RS-232 FIFO Used Register. 0 - input FIFO is empty, 255 - input FIFO is full.
0xC3EF          R     ROFR  Output RS-232 FIFO Free Register. 0 - output FIFO is full, 255 - output FIFO is empty.
0xC4EF          W     IMR   Interrupt Mask Register.
0xC4EF          R     ISR   Interrupt Source Register.
0xC5EF          RW    ZIBTR Input Buffer Threshold Register. Number of bytes in input buffer which triggers the interrupt if enabled. (Default 0x80)
0xC6EF          RW    ZITOR Input Buffer Timeout Register. Number of milliseconds after last byte arrived in input buffer when interrupt is triggered if enabled. (Default 0x01)
0xC7EF          W     CR    Command Register. Command set depends on API mode selected.
0xC7EF          R     ER    Error Register - command execution result code. Depends on command issued.
0xC8EF          RW    RIBTR Input Buffer Threshold Register. Number of bytes in input buffer which triggers the interrupt if enabled. (Default 0x80)
0xC9EF          RW    RITOR Input Buffer Timeout Register. Number of milliseconds after last byte arrived in input buffer when interrupt is triggered if enabled. (Default 0x01)


Data Register.
Get byte from input FIFO. Input FIFO must not be empty (xIFR > 0).
Put byte into output FIFO. Output FIFO must not be full (xOFR > 0).
Serves both ZiFi and RS-232. To select required device first read correspondent FIFO register.
E.g if ZIFR was read, ZiFi data will be read from DR.


Command register.
  All mode commands:
    Code     Command      Description
    000000oi Clear FIFOs  i: 1 - clear input FIFO, o: 1 - clear output FIFO.
    11110mmm Set API mode or disable API:
              0     API disabled.
              1     transparent: all data is sent/received to/from external UART directly.
              2..7  reserved.
    11111111 Get Version  ER returns highest supported API version. 0xFF - no API available.


Error register.
  All mode responses:
    Code Description
    0x00 OK - no error.
    0xFF REJ - command rejected.


Interrupt Mask Register.
Enables one-time trigger for particular interrupt source when correspondent bit written to 1.
Each interrupt event disables correspondent source, so must be written again to re-enable after interrupt routine has completed.
Works as mask on individual bits. E.g. two writes with 0b01 and 0b10 are equal to one write with 0b11.
bit 0 - Buffer threshold reached (ZIBTR).
bit 1 - Buffer timeout reached (ZITOR).
bit 2 - Buffer threshold reached (RIBTR).
bit 3 - Buffer timeout reached (RITOR).


Interrupt Source Register.
Return interrupt source after the interrupt has occured. Each interrupt source is represented by a bit.
Automatically cleared after read.
bit 0 - Buffer threshold reached (ZIBTR).
bit 1 - Buffer timeout reached (ZITOR).
bit 2 - Buffer threshold reached (RIBTR).
bit 3 - Buffer timeout reached (RITOR).

--------------------

Until initialization sequence performed API is disabled and the only command recognized is 'Set API mode'.

Initialization sequence:
- Send 'Set API mode = 1' command,
- Send 'Get Version' command,
- Read highest supported API mode from ER,
- Select desired API mode.

zifi_init:
  ; select API mode 1
  ld bc, 0xC7EF
  ld a, 0xF1
  out (c), a
  ; get highest supported API mode
  ld a, 0xFF
  out (c), a
  in a, (c)
  ; select desired API mode, if need
  ld a, mode  ; possible values are 0xF2..0xF7
  out (c), a

; read 128 bytes from ZiFi
zifi_read:
  ; set B to number of bytes (0x80)
  ld bc, 0x80EF
  ld hl, buf
